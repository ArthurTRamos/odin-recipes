    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a sausage and egg pizza, and man, is it delicious. You may never eat eggs any other way, and you may never eat pizza any other way again.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Cornmeal</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook and stir sliced Italian sausage in a skillet over medium heat until some of the fat has rendered out and sausage is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage slices to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll pizza dough out to about 12 inches in diameter and about 3/8-inch thick; sprinkle with cornmeal. Flip dough so the cornmeal side is down and transfer to a perforated 14-inch pizza pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread pizza sauce in a thin layer on top of the dough. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and about 3/4 the Fontina cheese. Spread sausage slices onto the pizza, leaving 4 spaces about 3 inches across on the pizza for eggs. Sprinkle remaining Fontina cheese onto sausage slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until dough is hot, edges are starting to brown, and cheese has started to melt, 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack each egg into a separate ramekin or small bowl. Remove pizza from oven and use a spatula to press the spaces between sausage slices flat. Gently pour an egg onto each space. Grind a little black pepper onto each egg yolk. Lightly sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over entire pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return to oven and bake until eggs are set but yolks are still liquid, about 5 minutes, checking frequently to avoid overcooking eggs. Toss arugula leaves with olive oil in a bowl until coated. Remove pizza from oven, poke egg yolks with a fork, spread them around a little, and sprinkle arugula over the top of the pizza. Cut into 4 quarters, each with an egg, to serve.
